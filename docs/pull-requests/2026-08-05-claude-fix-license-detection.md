# fix: restore the Apache-2.0 appendix template

> **This document was rewritten after the change merged.** Its first version claimed GitHub could not detect the

## What this change does

`LICENSE` had the Apache-2.0 appendix's placeholder line replaced with a filled-in project block:

```diff
-   Title: Miniforge App Foundation
-   Subtitle: the public seam — app envelope, data-plane router, workbench contract
-   Author: Christopher Lester
-   Copyright 2025-2026 Christopher Lester (christopher@miniforge.ai)
+   Copyright [yyyy] [name of copyright owner]
```

The appendix is part of the licence *template*. It instructs a reader on how to apply the licence to their own work,
and `Copyright [yyyy] [name of copyright owner]` is a placeholder that is meant to stay a placeholder — substituting
real values makes the instructions read as though they were about this project rather than about the reader's. That is
worth getting right in a repository whose whole purpose is to be depended on from outside. After this change the file
matches a canonical Apache-2.0 text exactly, verified by a whitespace-normalised diff against
`fnv-1.0.7/LICENSE-APACHE`.

Nothing is lost. The real attribution is unchanged in every source file's Apache-2.0 header, each crate manifest's
`license = "Apache-2.0"`, and the README.

## The wrong diagnosis, and why it was wrong

The change was opened on the premise that GitHub reported the licence as undetected and that the modified appendix was
the cause. Both halves were false.

The evidence for "undetected" was `gh repo view --json licenseInfo`, which returns `null`. That reads GitHub's GraphQL
`licenseInfo` field. The REST equivalent, `gh api repos/OWNER/REPO -q .license.spdx_id`, returns `Apache-2.0` — and did
so before this change.

| Repository | REST `.license.spdx_id` | GraphQL `licenseInfo.spdxId` |
|---|---|---|
| `miniforge-app-foundation` | `Apache-2.0` | `null` |
| `minibench` | `Apache-2.0` | `null` |
| `miniforge` | `Apache-2.0` | `null` |

The decisive case is the third row. `miniforge` still carries the modified appendix and was never touched by this work,
and GitHub detects its licence anyway. So the appendix modification never blocked detection, and the GraphQL `null` is a
property of that field across these repositories rather than a signal about any LICENSE file.

The error was accepting a single tool's output as the measurement without first checking it against a control. Running
the same query against a repository whose licence is known-detected would have shown the instrument was at fault in
under a minute.

## Lesson for the next licence or metadata check

Use `gh api repos/OWNER/REPO -q .license.spdx_id`, not `gh repo view --json licenseInfo`. When a check reports a
problem, run it against a known-good control before acting on it.
